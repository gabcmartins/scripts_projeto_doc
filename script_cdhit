#after removal of redundancy, files were edited to contain the name of the family at the identification line, using the following:
#!/bin/bash

# Loop through the target files
for file in nr_GH*.fasta; do
    # Extract the CAZy family from the filename (e.g., GH101)
    family=$(echo "$file" | grep -o 'GH[0-9]\+')

    sed "s/^>\([^ ]*\)/>$family.\1/" "$file" > "mod_$file"

done

#Also, files were concatenaded. This allowed to make only one database for comparison with diamond.
